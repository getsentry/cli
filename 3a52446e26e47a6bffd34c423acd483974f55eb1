## Implementation Plan

### Problem
Unicode arrow → (U+2192) has East Asian Width "Ambiguous", causing inconsistent rendering across terminals/fonts. Some render it as 2 cells while cursor advances 1, eating the following space.

Reported with Iosevka font where the update notification showed no space after the arrow.

### Options Considered
1. **ASCII arrow `->`** (chosen) - 100% consistent across all terminals
2. Extra padding (2 spaces) - Doesn't fix root cause
3. Different Unicode arrow - Still ambiguous width
4. string-width library - Overkill for this issue

### Changes
Replaced → with -> in 4 user-facing output strings:
- src/lib/version-check.ts:136 (update notification)
- src/lib/formatters/human.ts:532 (release range)
- src/lib/formatters/human.ts:706 (HTTP breadcrumb status)
- src/lib/formatters/human.ts:710 (navigation breadcrumb)

Comments/docs left unchanged as they don't affect terminal output.
