## Implementation Plan

### Context
Craft 2.21.1 introduces several improvements:
- PR #709: artifactProvider.config.artifacts - filter artifacts by workflow and name patterns
- PR #739: noMerge config option with auto-detection for GitHub Actions
- PR #707: Automatic version bumping from configured targets

### Changes Made

#### .craft.yml
- minVersion: 2.19.0 → 2.21.1
- Removed requireNames (two regex patterns)
- Added artifactProvider with workflow-specific artifact filtering:
  - ci.yml workflow
  - Patterns: sentry-*, npm-package, gh-pages

#### .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Removed merge-artifacts job (downloaded all artifacts and re-uploaded as single SHA-named artifact)
- Updated ci-status job:
  - Dependencies: [changes, check-skill, merge-artifacts] → [changes, check-skill, build-binary, build-npm, build-docs, test-e2e]
  - Status checking logic now references test-e2e instead of merge-artifacts

### Benefits
1. Faster CI - eliminates redundant download/upload step
2. Cleaner config - artifact filtering at provider level
3. Leverages Craft 2.21.1 improvements
