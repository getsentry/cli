/**
 * Prepare WebAssembly modules for Sentry symbolication.
 *
 * A module compiled with DWARF carries its debug info inline, which is far too
 * large to ship to users and useless to Sentry unless uploaded separately.
 * Preparing a module splits it in two: a `*.debug.wasm` companion retaining
 * every section, and a deployable module with the `.debug_*` sections removed.
 * Both carry the same `build_id`, which is how Sentry matches a stack frame to
 * its debug file.
 *
 * The companion must keep the Code section: DWARF addresses are relative to it,
 * so a companion without it cannot be symbolicated. This mirrors the split
 * performed by Symbolicator's `wasm-split`, so companions produced by either
 * tool are interchangeable in Sentry.
