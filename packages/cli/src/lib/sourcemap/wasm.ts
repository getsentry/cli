/**
 * Debug IDs for WebAssembly modules and their sourcemaps.
 *
 * Emscripten's `-gsource-map` emits `app.wasm` next to `app.wasm.map`, a plain
 * Source Map v3 file. Sentry identifies a wasm module by the `build_id` custom
 * section, which events report as `debug_meta.images[].debug_id`, and matches
 * uploaded maps by the `debug_id` field inside the map JSON. This module puts
 * the same id on both sides so the two artifacts join up.
 *
 * The module's `build_id` is the source of truth: it is what the running
 * module reports, and unlike the JS path there is nothing to derive from
 * content. A map that disagrees is corrected, not adopted.
 *
 * The wasm path deliberately shares nothing with JS injection beyond
 * discovery settings. A module is binary — it gets no `//# debugId=` comment,
 * no runtime snippet, and its map needs no `mappings` offset.
