/**
 * sentry debug-files prepare <path>...
 *
 * Scan for WebAssembly modules, split the ones carrying inline DWARF into a
 * deployable module plus a `*.debug.wasm` companion, and upload the companions
 * to Sentry.
 *
 * This replaces the two-step `wasm-split` + `debug-files upload` workflow. The
 * split matches what Symbolicator's `wasm-split` produces, so companions from
 * either tool are interchangeable in Sentry.
 *
 * Modules that cannot be split are stamped with a `build_id` and reported with
 * a warning rather than failing the run, so scanning a build directory does not
 * stop at the first module without DWARF. Use `--require-dwarf` in CI to turn
 * that into an error.
