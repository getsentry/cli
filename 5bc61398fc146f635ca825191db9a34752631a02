## Implementation Plan

### Problem
Users on Node.js < 22 installing the Sentry CLI via pnpm (or npm/yarn without
strict engine enforcement) get a cryptic crash at startup:

  ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE: No such built-in module: node:sqlite
  Node.js v20.18.0

Root cause: the npm bundle (dist/bin.cjs) polyfills bun:sqlite using Node.js
22's built-in node:sqlite module. The polyfill is injected at the top of the
bundle via esbuild's inject option, so the require('node:sqlite') call happens
during module loading — before any user code runs and before any error handler
can catch it. package.json already declares engines: { node: '>=22' }, but
pnpm does not enforce engine constraints by default.

### Fix
Add a Node.js version guard to the esbuild banner in script/bundle.ts. The
banner is the very first code in dist/bin.cjs (before the injected polyfill),
so it fires before require('node:sqlite') is ever attempted.

Guard: parseInt(process.versions.node) < 22 → print clear error + exit(1).

Error message includes:
- The constraint violated (requires Node.js 22+)
- The version actually found (process.version)
- Actionable next steps: upgrade Node.js OR use the standalone binary
  (curl -fsSL https://cli.sentry.dev/install | bash)

### Alternatives considered
- Runtime check in src/bin.ts: too late — the polyfill import fails at module
  load time before bin.ts code runs.
- engine-strict in package.json: doesn't help users who already installed.
- better-sqlite3 as fallback: heavy native addon, defeats zero-dep goal.
