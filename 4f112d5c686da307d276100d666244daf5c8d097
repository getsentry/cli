## Implementation Plan: Parallel-with-Early-Exit Promise Helper

### Problem
Recurring pattern in codebase where we want to:
1. Start multiple async operations in parallel
2. Resolve as soon as any one succeeds (returns true)
3. Not wait for remaining operations

Used in anyExists() and anyGlobMatches() in src/lib/dsn/project-root.ts.

### Solution
Create generic helper anyTrue<T>() that:
- Runs predicates concurrently
- Resolves true on first truthy result
- Resolves false only when all complete with falsy/error
- Treats errors as false (consistent with file system checks)

### API
```typescript
function anyTrue<T>(
  items: readonly T[],
  predicate: (item: T) => Promise<boolean>
): Promise<boolean>;
```

### Design Decisions
1. No onError callback - keeps API simple, errors = false is correct for FS ops
2. No findFirst<T>() variant - existing use cases are boolean checks or require order
3. No AbortController - minimal overhead from redundant work

### Files
- src/lib/promises.ts: New helper (~60 lines)
- test/lib/promises.test.ts: 12 test cases (~115 lines)
- src/lib/dsn/project-root.ts: Refactored (-44 lines)

### Alternatives Considered
- Promise.race(): Resolves on first settlement regardless of value
- Promise.any(): Requires throwing on false, awkward API
- Sequential iteration: Slower when match is late in array
