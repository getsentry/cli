Implementation plan for #267

Problem
=======
The <target> placeholder in usage lines was opaque. Users had no way to know:
- Multiple input patterns are supported (auto-detect, explicit, org-all, project-search)
- The trailing / on <org>/ is significant syntax that changes behaviour entirely
  (switches from project-search to org-all, the only mode that accepts --cursor)

Root cause confirmed: parseOrgProjectArg in src/lib/arg-parsing.ts dispatches on
whether the argument contains a slash and whether the part before/after is empty.
A bare word with no slash always goes to project-search, never org-all.

Changes
=======
Five commands updated (issue/list, project/list, trace/list, log/list, project/view):

1. placeholder: 'target' → 'org/project'
   Usage line changes from [<target>] to [<org/project>], self-documenting the
   expected format without requiring the user to read --help.

2. fullDescription 'Target specification' → 'Target patterns'
   Clearer heading; 'specification' implied a formal grammar, 'patterns' is friendlier.

3. Trailing-slash explanation paragraph
   issue/list and project/list get the full explanation with a concrete example
   ('sentry' vs 'sentry/'). trace/list, log/list, project/view get a shorter note
   since they don't support cursor pagination.

4. project/list: '(trailing / required)' annotation on the org-all pattern line.

5. project/list: cursor ValidationError improvement
   Old: generic message about <org>/ pattern
   New: shorter base message + contextual hint when parsed.type === 'project-search':
     'Did you mean sentry project list <slug>/? A bare name searches for a project
     — add a trailing slash to list an org's projects.'

Alternatives considered
=======================
- Auto-promote bare-slug + --cursor to org-all mode: rejected because it changes
  silent behaviour and 'sentry' could be a project slug in one org and a valid
  org slug in another. Explicit > implicit for destructive ambiguity.
- Show a pattern table in fullDescription: prose is more readable in a terminal
  than a Markdown table that won't render; the example list already serves the
  same purpose.

Verification
============
bun run typecheck — passes (0 errors, 250 files)
bun run lint     — passes (no issues)
bun test         — all failures are pre-existing (DB permission issues, mock setup
                   problems); none are related to these help-text changes. No tests
                   reference the old placeholder text or old cursor error messages.
