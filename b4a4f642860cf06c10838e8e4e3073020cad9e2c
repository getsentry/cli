## Implementation Plan

### Problem
Three packages (ignore, p-limit, pretty-ms) leaked into the dependencies
field of package.json. The CLI goal is zero install-time dependencies —
everything is bundled at build time via esbuild (npm package) and
Bun.build (standalone binaries).

### Steps
1. Move ignore, p-limit, pretty-ms from dependencies to devDependencies
2. Remove the now-empty dependencies field from package.json
3. Run bun install to update bun.lock
4. Add script/check-no-deps.ts — CI script that reads package.json and
   exits non-zero if any runtime dependencies exist
5. Add check:deps npm script and wire it into the CI lint job
   (.github/workflows/ci.yml) alongside lint and typecheck
6. Add test/package.test.ts — unit test asserting package.json has no
   dependencies field, catches regressions locally before push

### Verification
- bun run typecheck — passes
- bun run lint — passes
- bun run check:deps — passes
- bun run bundle — produces working dist/bin.cjs (1030.5 KB)
- node dist/bin.cjs --help — works
- bun test test/package.test.ts — passes
