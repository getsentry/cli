## Implementation Plan: Auto-Install Agent Skills During Setup

### Problem
AI coding agents like Claude Code need a SKILL.md file to know how to use the
Sentry CLI. Installation was manual (`npx skills add`). We can automate this
during `sentry cli setup` since we already auto-install shell completions there.

### Version Mismatch Protection
Fetching from cli.sentry.dev always serves the latest SKILL.md, which may
document commands that do not exist in the installed binary. Solution: fetch from
raw.githubusercontent.com using the CLI version tag (e.g., /0.8.0/...SKILL.md).
For dev builds (0.0.0-dev, etc.), fall back to cli.sentry.dev since exact tags
do not exist.

### Detection Strategy
- Auto-detect: check if ~/.claude/ directory exists (created by Claude Code)
- Opt-out: --no-agent-skills flag (matching --no-completions pattern)
- Silent when no agent detected — no noise for non-Claude users

### Fetch Strategy
1. Build URL: raw.githubusercontent.com/getsentry/cli/{version}/plugins/sentry-cli/skills/sentry-cli/SKILL.md
2. If versioned URL returns non-200, fall back to cli.sentry.dev/.well-known/skills/sentry-cli/SKILL.md
3. For dev versions, go directly to fallback (skip step 1)
4. Network failures return null — never throw, setup continues

### Setup Flow (4 steps, was 3)
1. Record install metadata (if --method)
2. Add binary to PATH (unless --no-modify-path)
3. Install shell completions (unless --no-completions)
4. Install agent skills (NEW — unless --no-agent-skills or no agent detected)

### Files Changed
- NEW: src/lib/agent-skills.ts — detection, URL construction, fetch with fallback, install
- MOD: src/commands/cli/setup.ts — step 4 + --no-agent-skills flag
- NEW: test/lib/agent-skills.test.ts — 18 unit tests
- MOD: test/commands/cli/setup.test.ts — 4 new integration tests + --no-agent-skills on existing
- AUTO: plugins/sentry-cli/skills/sentry-cli/SKILL.md — regenerated for new flag

### What Stays Unchanged
- script/generate-skill.ts — still generates SKILL.md at build time
- docs/public/.well-known/skills/ — still serves for npx skills add
- plugins/ directory — still works for the npx skills flow
