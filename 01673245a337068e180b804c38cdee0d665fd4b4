## Implementation Plan

### Problem
Two runtime tags exist in Sentry for this project:
- `cli.runtime` — manually set, correctly shows `bun` or `node`
- `runtime` — promoted from event.contexts.runtime, always shows `node` even for Bun

### Root Cause
@sentry/bun v10 sets runtime: { name: 'bun' } but delegates to @sentry/node's
NodeClient, which always overrides it:

    const clientOptions = {
        ...options,           // bun's runtime gets spread here
        runtime: { name: 'node', version: global.process.version },  // then overridden
    };

Under Bun, process.version returns Node.js compat version (v24.3.0), not Bun version.
ServerRuntimeClient._prepareEvent() then sets event.contexts.runtime from this option,
and Sentry server promotes contexts.runtime.name to the `runtime` tag.

### Solution
Override client.getOptions().runtime after Sentry.init() returns, before any events
are sent. This works because ServerRuntimeClient._prepareEvent() reads from
this._options.runtime to populate event.contexts.runtime.

Note: Sentry.setContext("runtime", ...) does NOT work because _prepareEvent runs
before scope context merging and its result takes precedence.

### Alternatives Considered
- Sentry.setContext("runtime", ...) — doesn't work due to event processing order
- Patching @sentry/bun or @sentry/node-core — too invasive for a workaround
- Removing cli.runtime tag — would break existing dashboards/alerts
