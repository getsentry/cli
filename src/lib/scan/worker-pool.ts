/**
 * Worker pool for parallel file-grep work.
 *
 * Lazy-initialized singleton: the first call to `getWorkerPool()`
 * spawns N workers via a Blob URL (for compatibility with
 * `bun build --compile`'s single-file binary — see
 * `grep-worker.js` for the worker body + rationale). Subsequent
 * calls reuse the pool.
 *
 * ### Lifetime
 *
 * Workers are kept ref'd — they hold the event loop open. The CLI
 * relies on `process.exit()` at the end of command execution to
 * tear them down; no explicit shutdown is required from callers.
 *
 * An earlier iteration `.unref()`'d each worker for "clean" exit,
 * but that caused a deadlock: when the main thread's only pending
 * work was a promise awaiting a worker result, unref'd workers
 * didn't process messages on idle ticks and the pipeline hung with
 * in-flight batches never settling.
 *
 * `terminatePool()` is provided for tests that need to reset the
 * singleton between cases; it's not part of the CLI shutdown path.
 *
 * ### Feature-gate
 *
 * `isWorkerSupported()` returns true only when `Worker`, `Blob`,
 * and `URL.createObjectURL` are available. The Bun runtime and
 * Bun-compiled binaries always pass this check; the Node library
 * bundle (`dist/index.cjs`) may or may not depending on the
 * consumer's Node version. We avoid depending on `bun:*` or
 * `Bun.*` APIs so the same code works in both runtimes.
 *
 * When unsupported, callers fall back to the async
 * `mapFilesConcurrent` path.
