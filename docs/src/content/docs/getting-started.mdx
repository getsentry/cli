import PackageManagerCode from "../../components/PackageManagerCode.astro";

## Installation

### Install Script

Install the latest stable release:

```bash
curl https://cli.sentry.dev/install -fsS | bash
```

Install the nightly build (built from `main`, updated on every commit):

```bash
curl https://cli.sentry.dev/install -fsS | bash -s -- --version nightly
```

The chosen channel is persisted so that `sentry cli upgrade` automatically
tracks the same channel on future updates.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry
```

### Package Managers

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerCode
  npm="npm install -g sentry"
  pnpm="pnpm add -g sentry"
  yarn="yarn global add sentry"
  bun="bun add -g sentry"
/>

Or run directly without installing:

<PackageManagerCode
  npm="npx sentry --help"
  pnpm="pnpm dlx sentry --help"
  yarn="yarn dlx sentry --help"
  bun="bunx sentry --help"
/>

## Authentication

### OAuth Device Flow (Recommended)

The easiest way to authenticate is via OAuth device flow:

```bash
sentry auth login
```

You'll be given a URL and a code to enter. Once you authorize the application in your browser, the CLI will automatically receive your token.

### API Token

Alternatively, you can use an API token directly:

```bash
sentry auth login --token YOUR_SENTRY_API_TOKEN
```

You can create API tokens in your [Sentry account settings](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/).

### Check Auth Status

Verify your authentication status:

```bash
sentry auth status
```

### Logout

To remove stored credentials:

```bash
sentry auth logout
```

## Configuration

Credentials are stored in `~/.sentry/config.json` with restricted file permissions (mode 600) for security.

## Next Steps

Once authenticated, you can start using the CLI:

- [Organization commands](../commands/org/) - List and view organizations
- [Project commands](../commands/project/) - Manage projects
- [Issue commands](../commands/issue/) - Track and manage issues
- [Event commands](../commands/event/) - Inspect events
- [API commands](../commands/api/) - Direct API access
- [Agentic Usage](../agentic-usage/) - Enable AI coding agents to use the CLI
