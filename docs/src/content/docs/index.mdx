## What makes it different

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Zero Configuration" icon="setting">
    Auto-detects your Sentry project from .env files or Sentry.init() in your code. No more --org and --project flags. Works with monorepos too.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OAuth Like gh" icon="approve-check">
    Run sentry auth login and you're done. Opens your browser, shows a QR code as fallback, handles token refresh automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Short IDs" icon="rocket">
    Just type sentry issue view WQ instead of the full CRAFT-WQ. The CLI figures out the rest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Powered Debugging" icon="star">
    Run sentry issue explain for root cause analysis. Run sentry issue plan and get a solution. Powered by Seer.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built for Agents" icon="external">
    Designed to work with AI coding agents. Structured outputs, predictable behavior, complements the MCP.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Great DX" icon="heart">
    JSON output for scripting, -w flags to open in browser, smart defaults everywhere. Developer experience first.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
