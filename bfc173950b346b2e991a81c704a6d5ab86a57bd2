Implementation Plan for "Failed to fetch issues from N project(s)" fix

Root Cause Analysis (CLI-3Q: 132 events, CLI-N: 81 events):
- fetchIssuesForTarget() (lines 355-381) catches all errors and converts
  them to { success: false, errorType: "permission"|"network"|"unknown" }
  — the original error object is completely discarded.
- Only 401/403 classified as "permission". All other ApiErrors (400, 404,
  429, 500) fall through to "unknown".
- When all fetches fail, lines 490-508 throw a plain Error (not CliError
  or ApiError), so telemetry always calls captureException — no
  suppression rule matches it.
- JSON output silently drops partial failures with zero indication that
  data is incomplete.
- Highest-volume case (CLI-3Q) is a user running
  `sentry issue list tuple-app/ --json --query "..."` — all 12 project
  fetches likely fail with 400 Bad Request (invalid query syntax) but
  the error detail is swallowed.

Changes:
A. Preserve underlying errors in FetchResult:
   Add the original error object to the failure case so it can be
   used downstream for re-throwing and messaging.

B. Extract classifyApiError() helper:
   Classify API errors into granular types: permission (401/403),
   not_found (404), rate_limit (429), bad_request (other 4xx),
   unknown (5xx+). Keeps fetchIssuesForTarget complexity manageable.

C. Throw ApiError when underlying errors are ApiError:
   Propagate the first ApiError so PR #251 isClientApiError()
   suppresses it from telemetry. Include detail/message from original.

D. Include partial failure info in JSON output:
   When some projects succeed but others fail, JSON output includes
   { issues: [...], errors: [...] } instead of silently dropping
   failures. Plain array when all succeed (backward compat).
   Human output gets a muted stderr warning about partial failures.
