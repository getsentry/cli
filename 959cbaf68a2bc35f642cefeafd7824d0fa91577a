## Implementation Plan: Homebrew Install Support (#228)

### Problem
The CLI had no Homebrew install option, making it harder to install and
manage on macOS/Linux for users who prefer brew.

### Approach

#### 1. Craft brew target (.craft.yml)
Added a `brew` target that Craft runs at release time to push a formula
to the getsentry/homebrew-tools tap as `Formula/sentry.rb`:
- `includeNames: '/^sentry-(darwin|linux)-(arm64|x64)$/'` filters to
  the 4 relevant release binaries (excludes .gz, Windows exe, npm tarball)
- Checksum keys are raw filenames (e.g. `{{checksums.sentry-darwin-arm64}}`)
  because the filenames contain no dots and no version string — verified
  against Craft source at src/targets/brew.ts (key = filename.replace(version, '__VERSION__'),
  sanitizeObject only transforms dots to __)
- Pre-release versions (dev, rc, alpha, etc.) are auto-skipped by Craft
- Same-org tap (getsentry owns both repos) — direct commit path works

#### 2. Upgrade system (src/lib/upgrade.ts)
- Added `"brew"` to `InstallationMethod` union
- `isHomebrewInstall()`: checks `process.execPath` for `/Cellar/`, which
  is reliable for both Apple Silicon (/opt/homebrew) and Intel (/usr/local)
- Homebrew checked before curl in legacy detection to avoid false matches
- `fetchLatestVersion` and `versionExists` route brew to GitHub releases
- `executeUpgradeHomebrew()`: runs `brew upgrade getsentry/tools/sentry`;
  version pinning unsupported (Homebrew manages versions through the formula)
- brew returns null from executeUpgrade (like package managers), so the
  upgrade command uses `process.execPath` for post-upgrade setup

#### 3. Docs
- getting-started.mdx: Homebrew section between Install Script and Package Managers
- commands/cli/upgrade.md: brew row in detection/method tables, --method options

### What was NOT needed
- No CI/workflow changes — Craft handles formula generation at release time
- No changes to binary build — existing release artifacts are already correct
- No manual tap repo setup — Craft creates the formula file on first release
