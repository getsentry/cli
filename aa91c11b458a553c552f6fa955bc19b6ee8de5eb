## Implementation Plan: Skip 4xx API Error Telemetry

### Problem
CLI-5M and CLI-46 are both `ApiError: 404 Not Found` from users referencing
non-existent resources (wrong issue/event IDs). These are user errors, not bugs,
but they were being reported via captureException, creating noise.

### Approach: Record as span data (Option C)
Skip captureException for 4xx ApiErrors, but record them as span attributes
so they are queryable in Discover/Explore for volume-spike detection.

This balances noise reduction with the ability to detect regressions —
if we accidentally break API URL construction, a volume spike of 4xx errors
on spans would be detectable via Discover queries.

### Changes

1. **src/lib/telemetry.ts**
   - Add `isClientApiError(error): boolean` helper (exported for testing)
   - Inner catch in startSpanManual: set api_error.status, api_error.message,
     api_error.detail as span attributes before span.end()
   - Outer catch: skip captureException and markSessionCrashed for client API errors

2. **test/lib/telemetry.test.ts**
   - 10 tests for isClientApiError: 400/403/404/429 → true; 500/502/non-ApiError/
     AuthError/null/plain objects → false
   - 1 withTelemetry test confirming 4xx ApiError propagates to caller

### Queryable after deployment
- `api_error.status:*` — all spans with client API errors
- `api_error.status:404` — specifically 404s
- Volume over time for regression detection

### Not changed
- 5xx ApiErrors still reported as exceptions (server bugs are actionable)
- AuthError("not_authenticated") still skipped (existing behavior)
- Errors still propagate to bin.ts for user-facing formatting
