Implementation plan for #267

Problem
=======
The <target> placeholder in usage lines was opaque. Users had no way to know:
- Multiple input patterns are supported (auto-detect, explicit, org-all, project-search)
- The trailing / on <org>/ is significant syntax that changes behaviour entirely
  (switches from project-search to org-all, the only mode that accepts --cursor)

Root cause confirmed: parseOrgProjectArg in src/lib/arg-parsing.ts dispatches on
whether the argument contains a slash and whether the part before/after is empty.
A bare word with no slash always goes to project-search, never org-all.

Architecture note
=================
main was significantly refactored between our original branch and now (#262):
- LIST_TARGET_POSITIONAL shared constant in src/lib/list-command.ts replaces
  the inline positional blocks in issue/list and project/list
- dispatchOrgScopedList in src/lib/org-list.ts centralises mode dispatch and
  cursor validation, replacing the inline switch in project/list
The placeholder fix (Edit 1) and cursor error improvement (Edit 4) were applied
to these shared locations instead of the individual command files.

Changes
=======
Seven files updated:

1. src/lib/list-command.ts — LIST_TARGET_POSITIONAL
   placeholder: 'target' → 'org/project'; brief updated to describe all patterns.
   Used by issue/list, project/list, and the buildOrgListCommand factory.

2. src/commands/issue/list.ts — fullDescription only
   'Target specification' → 'Target patterns'; trailing-slash annotation on
   the org-all line; prose paragraph explaining the trailing-slash semantics.

3. src/commands/project/list.ts — fullDescription only
   Same as above, plus note that --cursor requires the <org>/ form.

4. src/lib/org-list.ts — dispatchOrgScopedList cursor ValidationError
   Old: generic 'only supported when listing X for a specific organization'
   New: shorter 'requires the <org>/ pattern' + contextual hint when
   parsed.type === 'project-search': 'Did you mean sentry X list <slug>/?
   A bare name searches for a project — add a trailing slash to list an
   org's projects.'

5-7. trace/list, log/list, project/view
   'Target specification' → 'Target patterns'; added short bare-name note;
   placeholder/brief updated on the inline positional (these commands do not
   use LIST_TARGET_POSITIONAL).

Alternatives considered
=======================
- Auto-promote bare-slug + --cursor to org-all mode: rejected — 'sentry' could
  be a project slug in one org and a valid org in another. Explicit > implicit.
- Pattern table in fullDescription: prose reads better in a terminal than a
  Markdown table; the example list serves the same purpose.

Verification
============
bun run typecheck — passes (0 errors, 261 files)
bun run lint     — passes (no issues)
