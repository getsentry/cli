## Implementation Plan

### Problem
Publishing with craft fails with:
  Error: No artifacts matching filters found for revision "..." (tries: 3)

### Root Cause
Craft's GitHubArtifactProvider.filterWorkflowRuns() matches the artifact
config keys against workflow run.name (the workflow's `name:` field in YAML),
not the workflow filename. Our .craft.yml used `ci.yml` (the filename) but
the workflow declares `name: CI`.

The filter `ci.yml` becomes regex /^ci\.yml$/ which never matches "CI",
so all workflow runs are filtered out, no artifacts are found, and craft
fails after 3 retries.

### Fix
Change the artifact filter key from `ci.yml` to `CI` to match the
workflow's declared name.

### Verification
- Confirmed in craft source: src/artifact_providers/github.ts line 315
  uses run.name for matching
- Confirmed in craft source: src/utils/filters.ts line 40-44 converts
  non-regex strings to exact match patterns
- The error message says "No artifacts matching filters" (not "No workflow
  runs found"), confirming runs exist but are filtered out
