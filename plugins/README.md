| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [sentry-cli](sentry-cli/skills/sentry-cli/SKILL.md) | Guide for using the Sentry CLI to interact with Sentry |

## Usage

Once installed, ask your AI assistant questions like:

- "How do I list my Sentry issues?"
- "How do I view an issue in Sentry?"
- "How do I authenticate with Sentry CLI?"
- "How do I make API calls to Sentry?"
- "How do I resolve an issue via the CLI?"

The skill will guide the assistant to provide accurate CLI commands.

## Updating SKILL.md

The SKILL.md file is **auto-generated** from the CLI's command definitions. Do not edit it manually.

To regenerate after modifying commands:

```bash
bun run generate:skill
```

CI will fail if SKILL.md is out of date and post a comment with the required changes.
