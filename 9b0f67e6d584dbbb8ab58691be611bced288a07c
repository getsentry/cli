Implementation Plan

## Problem
The /users/me/ endpoint returns 403 for OAuth tokens (including OAuth App
tokens). This caused user info fetching to silently fail, requiring a
try-catch fallback in the --token login path. The /auth/ endpoint works
with all token types and lives on the control silo (sentry.io for SaaS).

## Changes

1. getCurrentUser() in src/lib/api-client.ts
   - Changed endpoint from /users/me/ to /auth/
   - Updated JSDoc to document the token compatibility guarantee

2. src/commands/auth/login.ts
   - Removed try-catch around getCurrentUser() for --token login
   - User info is now always fetched and stored (no more silent failures)
   - Simplified: removed the conditional display of 'Logged in as'

3. src/commands/auth/whoami.ts (new)
   - Fetches live user identity from /auth/
   - Displays name, email, username via formatUserIdentity()
   - Supports --json for machine consumption
   - Updates cached user info in the DB on each call
   - Available as both `sentry auth whoami` and `sentry whoami`

4. src/commands/auth/index.ts
   - Registered whoamiCommand as 'whoami' subcommand
   - Updated fullDescription to mention the new command

5. src/app.ts
   - Imported whoamiCommand and added as top-level alias
   - Follows same pattern as issues/orgs/projects shortcuts

## Design Decisions
- whoami is separate from status: status shows full auth state (token,
  expiry, defaults, org verification); whoami shows only user identity
- Top-level alias follows gh CLI convention for common operations
- /auth/ routing: getControlSiloUrl() already returns sentry.io for SaaS,
  so no special host-override logic needed (unlike sentry-mcp's approach)
