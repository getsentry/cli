## Implementation Note

The original PR #270 attempted a larger refactor (listCommand factory in
list-helpers.ts), but PR #262 landed concurrently with an equivalent approach
(dispatchOrgScopedList + buildOrgListCommand in list-command.ts / org-list.ts).

After rebasing and finding the overlap, this was scoped down to just the
remaining gap: org/list was the one list command not using the shared
list-command.ts constants. The change is minimal on purpose — the func body
is unchanged, only the flag definitions are replaced with shared constants.
